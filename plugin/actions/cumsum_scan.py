"""Cumsum-based AORC scan — O(area × T) instead of O(area × D × num_dates).

The upstream pipeline reads ``storm_duration`` hours of precip per
storm-date and sums them. With ``check_every_n_hours`` < ``storm_duration``
consecutive windows overlap heavily — each hour of data gets read and
summed roughly ``storm_duration / check_every_n_hours`` times.

This module sweeps each year once. For every storm-date we only need
two snapshots of the running cumulative sum (one at the window start,
one just past the window end), so the algorithm is:

1. For each year, compute the set of "times of interest" — for each
   storm-date ``d``, ``i_start = idx_of(d + 1h)`` and ``i_end1 = idx_of(d + D) + 1``.
2. Stream the year's transposition-bbox precip in time-chunks
   (default 720h = 1 month). Maintain a running cumulative sum
   ``(Y, X) float64``. Whenever the stream passes a time-of-interest,
   snapshot the running sum.
3. For each storm-date: ``window_sum = snapshot[i_end1] - snapshot[i_start]``,
   feed into the reused ``Transpose`` object, write CSV row.

Peak memory is bounded by one chunk + the snapshot pool (~3 GB for a
1000×1000 transposition bbox), not by the full-year cube (which would
be tens of GB for large domains).

Bit-equivalent to upstream at valid shifts. ``valid_shifts`` is
computed once from a 2D template that has the rio.clip NaN pattern.
At any valid shift the watershed window only overlaps cells that were
finite in the original data, so treating NaN as 0 in the running sum
cannot perturb any mean we'll actually emit.

Gating: on by default — set ``CC_CUMSUM_SCAN=0`` to opt out. Chunk size:
``CC_CUMSUM_CHUNK_HOURS`` (default 720).
